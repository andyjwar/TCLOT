# Deploy slowly — data + team logos

Two separate things ship to GitHub Pages: **JSON league data** and **PNG logos**.

---

## 1. League data (standings, fixtures, waivers)

The live site reads **`league-data/details.json`** (and other JSON next to it).

### Path A — automatic (recommended)

1. GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add **Repository secret** named exactly: **`FPL_LEAGUE_ID`**
3. Value = the number in your draft URL:  
   `draft.premierleague.com/league/`**`123456`**
4. Push any commit (or run the workflow).

On each build, GitHub runs **`ingest.py`** with that ID, then builds the site.  
**If the secret lived only under “Environment” before, it never reached the build step** — that’s fixed now by tying the build job to the same `github-pages` environment, but **Repository secret** is still the simplest.

You can also set **Repository variable** `FPL_LEAGUE_ID` (Settings → Variables) if you prefer — same name.

### Path B — commit files

```bash
python3 ingest.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID
cd web && npm run publish-real-league
git add web/public/league-data/
git commit -m "League data" && git push
```

## 2. Team logos (PNG)

Logos are **not** fetched from FPL. They only exist if **you** put files in the repo.

1. Put images in **`web/public/team-logos/`**
2. Name them **`{id}.png`** where `id` is each team’s **`league_entries[].id`** from `details.json`
3. Commit and push:

```bash
git add web/public/team-logos/
git commit -m "Logos" && git push
```

The build generates **`team-logos-web/`** from those PNGs. No PNGs in git → site shows letter bubbles only.

---

## 3. Check what actually deployed

After a successful deploy, open (replace with your site):

**`https://YOUR_USER.github.io/YOUR_REPO/deploy-check.json`**

You’ll see something like:

```json
{
  "leagueName": "...",
  "teamCount": 8,
  "isDemoData": false,
  "teamLogosPngInDist": 0,
  ...
}
```

- **`isDemoData: true`** → data path A or B above isn’t wired yet  
- **`teamLogosPngInDist: 0`** → no PNGs were in the repo at build time  

In **Actions → latest run → build job log**, look for:

- `Ingest: league ID is configured` vs `No FPL_LEAGUE_ID`
- `Team logo PNGs in build: N`

## 4. Common mistakes

| Symptom | Cause |
|--------|--------|
| Demo league / yellow banner | No `FPL_LEAGUE_ID` and no real committed `league-data` |
| Wrong league | Wrong ID in secret |
| Letter avatars only | `team-logos/*.png` not committed |
| Blank / broken site | Open site at correct URL: `…github.io/repo-name/` (often lowercase) |
