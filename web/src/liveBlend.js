/**
 * Live-blended Odds projections for the live fixture card.
 *
 * The static `predictions.json` forecast is a *pre-deadline* estimate that never
 * changes during the gameweek. These helpers blend it with the live squad rows
 * (banked points + match progress) so the Odds tab can show a projection that
 * tracks the game: points already scored are locked in, and only the remaining
 * portion of each player's match is still modelled.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   - 'prematch' — pure forecast (ignores live data); mirrors the pre-deadline numbers.
 *   - 'live'     — per-player blend of banked stats + time-scaled remaining forecast.
 *
 * All functions are pure so the blend can be unit-tested without React.
